TODO List TextMate Bundle
-------------------------

I like to keep my todo lists very simple and this bundle helps me do 
so. Usually it's just a TODO file at the root of my project which looks 
something like this.

  Widget Factory - the ultimate widget maker
  - design widgets
  - print blueprint
  ? create molding
  % make widget
  x design advertisement
  - design website
  ! get rich

Here's what the various symbols mean.

  - = issue to be resolved
  x = issue is resolved, ready for checking and removal
  + = issue on hold or waiting on someone
  ? = issue is questionable (not sure or not clear)
  % = issue is too big, it should be broken down into multiple smaller issues
  ! = issue is urgent

To install this bundle, just download and double click the bundle. Or 
use a tool like GetBundles.

See the Railscasts theme for syntax highlighting.
